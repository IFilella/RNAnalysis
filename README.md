# PolyPharmacology_SARS-CoV-2

This repository offers a series of Python scripts designed to analyze the three-dimensional structure of multiple RNA molecules.

--- 3D_RNAlysis is currently under development ---

## Features
- **Base Pair Detection:** The included scripts allow for the identification of single chain RNAs intra-bp, returning the type of interaction (Watson-Crick, Hogsteen, Sugar) using Biotite packages.
- **Hydrogen Bond Identification:** In addition to base pairs, the user is allowed to compute all H-bonds in a RNA structure for a more exhaustive analysis.
- **RNA Superimposition:** Given a multiple set of RNAs, 3D-RNAlysis can superpose the structures and compute RMSD and TM-score using US-align packages using two methods.
  - 1 vs 1: Every structure is superimposed with the rest of files in order to generate a matrix of RMSDs and TM-scores
  - All vs All: Given a multiple set of structures, a single superposition is given for all RNAs with a unique average RMSD.
- **Analysis and Clustering:**
